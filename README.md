Modeling the queue in a coffee shop

Formulation of the problem
It is necessary to build a queuing system in which:

 - the number of applications at the entrance is unlimited;
 - the emergence of new customers occurs at random intervals;
 - the length of the queue is limited;
 - customers are served by the rule "first come - first served";
 - the number of phases (stages) of service is 2 - cashiers and baristas (coffee makers);
 - number of channels at each stage 2 (two cashiers and two baristas);
 - service time at the cash desk stage and service time at the order execution stage depends on the order itself and the speed of the employee;
